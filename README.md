## Summary

Looking at the above results, starting a bike sharing business in Des Moines would be a sustainable business if the target consumer are men. One thing to take in consideration is the layout of the city. If Des Moines is a city where the average trip would take less than 20 minutes on bike, there is a opportunity for the bike share to have success. This I beleive is important, since New York is know for being a city with Walkable areas. Des Moines being a significantly smaller city might be more spread out, and the bike rides could be longer. If that is the case the data shows that the number of users riding longer than 15 minutes significantly drops for all patrons. Two additional visualizations that would help make a more informed decision for future analysis would be visualizing the age range of the riders. Also, what key landmarks are near the most visited stations.
